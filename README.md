# Salmon Disease Detection

This project involved the implementation of one of the most popular deep learning algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to distinguish between images of fresh and infected salmon. The model developed using Python code in a Jupyter Notebook reached 92.2% of accuracy and 91.5% of precision when predicting classes on the test dataset.
